# What is this?
Camera shots jpg + raw, when reviewing pics on the PC normally I delete jpgs and raws are left orpahs. This script will remove them.
This app search for ORF files with no matching JPG

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage:
```node
node index.js [--path] {directory} [--del]
```
--del will actually delete them, otherwise a preview is shown

### Modifying 
Open the file and change the file type extension according to your camera needs.
